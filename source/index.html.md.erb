# The Document Checking Service pilot

This technical documentation is for organisations taking part in the [Document Checking Service (DCS) pilot][govuk-link]. The pilot allows organisations to digitally check the validity of British passports.

We are currently onboarding selected pilot participants.

We will be refining the onboarding process as we go, and participants should therefore be aware that the process may change between iterations.
