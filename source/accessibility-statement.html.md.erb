## Accessibility statement for the Document Checking Service pilot documentation

This website is run by the Government Digital Service (GDS). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts
- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

[AbilityNet] has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

## Technical information about this website’s accessibility

GDS is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

This website is partially compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.

## Non accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non compliance with the accessibility regulations

Zooming and scaling does not work properly on mobile devices. This fails WCAG 2.1 criterion [1.4.4 (resize text)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=144#resize-text).

Some of the HTML elements do not have unique IDs. This fails WCAG 2.1 criterion [4.1.1 (parsing)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#parsing).

Some of the HTML elements do not have valid roles. This fails WCAG 2.1 criterion [4.1.2 (name, role, value)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#name-role-value).

We will make all these elements fully accessible by September 2020.

## How we tested this website

We last tested this website for accessibility issues in September 2019.

We used manual and automated tests to look for issues such as:

- lack of keyboard accessibility
- link text that’s not descriptive
- lack of colour contrast for text, important graphics and controls
- images not having meaningful alt text
- lack of subtitles for videos
- problems when using assistive technologies such as screen readers and screen magnifiers

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility

We will make changes to this website to make it fully accessible.

We will:

- make sure that zooming and scaling works on mobile devices
- give unique IDs to all HTML elements
- assign valid roles to all user facing components, such as links and navigation bars

We will make these changes by September 2020.

This statement was prepared on 20 September 2019. It was last updated on 20 September 2019.
