## Accessibility statement for the Document Checking Service pilot documentation

This accessibility statement applies to the Document Checking Service (DCS) pilot technical documentation at [https://dcs-pilot-docs.cloudapps.digital/#the-document-checking-service-pilot](https://dcs-pilot-docs.cloudapps.digital/#the-document-checking-service-pilot).

This website is run by the DCS team at the Government Digital Service (GDS). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts
- zoom in up to 300% without problems
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

We last tested this website for accessibility issues in August 2020.

We used manual and automated tests to look for issues such as:

- lack of keyboard accessibility
- link text that’s not descriptive
- non-unique or non-hierarchical headings
- italics, bold and block capital formatting
- inaccessible formatting in general
- inaccessible language
- inaccessible diagrams or images
- lack of colour contrast for text, important graphics and controls
- images not having meaningful alt text
- problems when using assistive technologies such as screen readers and screen magnifiers

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility

We plan to fix the other accessibility issues by [updating our Technical Documentation Template by the end of 2020](https://tdt-documentation.london.cloudapps.digital/accessibility#using-the-technical-documentation-template-for-your-own-documentation).

This statement was prepared on 20 September 2019. It was last updated on 14 September 2020.

This website was last tested in August 2020. The test was carried out by the technical writing team at GDS. We used the [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) and a checklist we created with the help of the GDS accessibility team. We tested all the website's pages.
