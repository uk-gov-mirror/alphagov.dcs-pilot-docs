# Send a test request to the DCS
You’ll now have a client which can:

* [sign and encrypt a Document Checking Service (DCS) payload](/sign-and-encrypt-a-DCS-payload/#sign-and-encrypt-a-dcs-payload)
* [make requests secured by mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)](/create-a-network-connection/#create-a-network-connection-to-the-dcs) to the DCS

You must check whether your client can make successful passport validity requests using the test passport data on this page.

Use the DCS integration endpoint for your test checks. [Contact the DCS team](/support) if you need the endpoint URL.


## Generate a `valid true` response

Enter these sample passport details in your client to test a `valid true` response.

```json
{
  "correlationId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "requestId": "af47ddc1-faa9-42fe-be1f-8131df114713",
  "timestamp": "1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00",
  "passportNumber": "824159121",
  "surname": "Watson",
  "forenames": [
    "Mary"
  ],
  "dateOfBirth": "1932-02-25",
  "expiryDate": "2021-03-01"
}
```

If your request is successful, you should receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "correlationId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "requestId": "af47ddc1-faa9-42fe-be1f-8131df114713",
  "error": false,
  "valid": true
}
```

If your response does not look similar to this, [contact the DCS team](/support).

## Generate a `valid false` response

Enter these sample passport details in your client to test a `valid false` response.

```json

  "requestId": "af47ddc1-faa9-42fe-be1f-8131df114713",
  "timestamp": "1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00",

  "requestId": "af47ddc1-faa9-42fe-be1f-8131df114713",
  "error": false,
  "valid": false
}

  "requestId": "af47ddc1-faa9-42fe-be1f-8131df114713",

  "errorMessage": [
    "Unplanned outage"
  ]
}
```
